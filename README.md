# Smart Restroom: Preventive Maintenance System using Machine Learning Algorithm

## Description
This is a compilation of the tests, prototypes and, modules of the project development thesis

# Modules
1. [Occupancy Module](/occupancy-module/) - This module is for the occupancy and visitor count that helps the machine learning by providing the raw data of the visitor count.
2. [Temperature and Humidity Module] - This module is for detecting the temperature and odor to get the raw data and to drive the exhaust fan if needed.
3. [Odor Detection Module] - This module is for detecting the amount of carbon dioxide in the area (Odor Smell) to drive the air freshener.
