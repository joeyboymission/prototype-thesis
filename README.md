# Smart Restroom: Preventive Maintenance System using Machine Learning Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a smart restroom system that uses machine learning algorithms for preventive maintenance. It monitors various environmental factors like occupancy, temperature, humidity and odor levels to optimize cleaning schedules and maintain air quality.

It is from the study entitled [Smart Restroom: Preventive Maintenance System using Machine Learning Algorithm] ()

## Features
- Real-time occupancy tracking and visitor counting
- Temperature and humidity monitoring
- Odor detection and automated air freshening
- Machine learning-based predictive maintenance
- Automated exhaust fan control

## Modules
1. [Occupancy Module](/occupancy-module/) - This module is for the occupancy and visitor count that helps the machine learning by providing the raw data of the visitor count.
2. [Temperature and Humidity Module](/temp-humidity-module/) - This module is for detecting the temperature and humidity levels to get environmental data and to drive the exhaust fan if needed.
3. [Odor Detection Module](/odor-module/) - This module is for detecting the amount of carbon dioxide in the area (Odor Smell) to drive the air freshener.

## Installation
This system will install to the specific site which is in the 4th Floor in the women's restroom.

The said layout has been designed using the "Sketchup" and all of the modules and components are attached respectively to it's designated spot.
